# MetaMask Integration Overview

MetaMask provides developers with a versatile set of tools to integrate their dapps across all platforms, including mobile and desktop. This guide highlights the capabilities of the **MetaMask SDK** and how it wraps the **MetaMask API** (JSON-RPC), giving developers the power to build seamless, cross-platform experiences.

## Why Use the MetaMask SDK?

The **MetaMask SDK** is your all-in-one toolkit for connecting dapps to the MetaMask ecosystem, covering both desktop and mobile platforms. It wraps the MetaMask API, providing everything you need for reliable wallet connectivity with additional mobile protocol support.

### Key Benefits of the MetaMask SDK

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Seamlessly connect to MetaMask on iOS, Android, React Native, and more.
- **Persistent Connections:** Maintain stable, long-term connections (up to 30+ days) to enhance user experience.
- **Mobile-First Focus:** Enjoy instant connections via deep linking, eliminating delays and retries for a faster user experience.
- **Advanced Features:** Batch transactions, RPC access, and EIP-6963 integration for wallet discovery and secure connections.
- **Ideal for Advanced Use Cases:** Perfect for developers building complex dapps for web3 ecosystems such as DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and beyond.

For more details on how the SDK can enhance your dapp, check out the [MetaMask SDK Product Overview](/wallet/connect/sdk/).

## The MetaMask API (JSON-RPC API)

For developers who need direct access to MetaMask‚Äôs core wallet functions, the **MetaMask API** allows you to:

- Interact with users' Ethereum accounts
- Perform actions like signing data, executing transactions, and listening for wallet events
- Build dapp logic directly within MetaMask or other Ethereum-compatible environments

The MetaMask API is wrapped within the SDK, but if you're looking for a simpler integration with fewer features, visit our [API Reference](/wallet/reference/json-rpc-api/) for more information on using the JSON-RPC API directly.
