# MetaMask Integration Overview

MetaMask provides developers with tools to integrate their dapps across desktop and mobile platforms. This guide introduces the **MetaMask SDK**, a comprehensive toolkit that simplifies wallet connectivity across platforms, and the **MetaMask API** (JSON-RPC).

## Why Use the MetaMask SDK?

The **MetaMask SDK** offers reliable wallet connections to MetaMask Extension and MetaMask Mobile from dapps and has additional features for seamless cross-platform integration.

### Key Benefits

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Connect to MetaMask across desktop, iOS, Android, React Native, and more.
- **Persistent and Seamless Connections:** Reduce reconnections and offer a smoother experience, especially on mobile.
- **Mobile-First:** Utilize instant deep links and advanced features for faster wallet interactions.

For a full overview of features, refer to the [MetaMask SDK Product Overview](/connect/metamask-sdk/index.md).

## Using the MetaMask API

For developers who need direct control, the **MetaMask API (JSON-RPC)** provides access to Ethereum accounts, signing data, and other core wallet functions.

- Interact with users' Ethereum accounts
- Perform actions like signing data, executing transactions, and listening for wallet events
- Build dapp logic directly within MetaMask or other Ethereum-compatible environments
