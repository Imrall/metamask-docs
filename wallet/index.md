# Integrate your dapp with the MetaMask wallet

Integrate your dapp with MetaMask using **MetaMask SDK**, a comprehensive toolkit that simplifies
wallet connectivity across desktop and mobile platforms, and MetaMask's **Wallet API**, which offers
a flexible way to interact with wallets and blockchain networks through standardized JSON-RPC calls.

Get started by [connecting to MetaMask](connect/index.md).

## Why use MetaMask SDK?

**MetaMask SDK** enables a reliable connection from your dapp to the MetaMask browser extension and
MetaMask Mobile, and seamlessly integrates from the platform of your choice, ensuring a
secure and consistent user experience.
Key benefits include:

- **Cross-platform compatibility** – Connect to MetaMask from desktop, iOS, Android, React Native, and other platforms.
- **Persistent and seamless connections** – Reduce reconnections and offer a smoother user experience, especially on mobile.
- **Mobile-first** – Use instant deep links and advanced features for faster wallet interactions.
- **Enhanced functionality** – Batch transactions, RPC access, and [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) integration for wallet discovery and security.

For dapps that need direct control, the **Wallet API** provides access to Ethereum accounts, signing
data, and other core wallet functions.
Dapps can call Wallet API methods with or without the SDK installed.
